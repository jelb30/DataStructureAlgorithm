#  Data Structures and Algorithms: The Java Adventure

Welcome to my digital playground for all things DSA! This repository is where I dive into Java, wrestle with algorithms, and sometimes even question my life choices‚Äîall in the name of learning and fun.

##  What's This Repository About?
This is my personal journey through the world of Data Structures & Algorithms. It‚Äôs a mix of learning logs, code experiments, and a collection of those "What was I thinking?" moments. Here, you'll find:
- **Data Structures:** From arrays to trees, all crafted in Java.
- **Algorithms:** Sorting, searching, graph traversal‚Äîyou name it.
- **LeetCode Solutions:** A steadily growing archive of my attempts, successes, and the occasional debugging marathon.
